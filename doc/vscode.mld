{1 Vscode support }

Support for Visual Studio Code and VSCodium is not directly provided by Merlin.
You can check the {{:https://github.com/ocamllabs/vscode-ocaml-platform}OCaml
Platform} extension and the associated
{{:https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-lsp}OCaml-LSP} project. These tools use Merlin
under the hood to provide coding assistance.
