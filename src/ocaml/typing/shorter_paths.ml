(* Shortening a path

   Typing records the paths the user wrote and the names brought in scope (U,
   see [Discourse]). From U we derive D, the names worth trying as replacements:
   the paths of U, the components of the modules of U (rule D3), the paths used
   in the declarations of U, and the substitutions obtained from aliases and
   opens (a path under an alias target can be written under the alias).

   Given a path to print, we want the lightest name of D that denotes the same
   thing in the printing environment, the weight of a name being the sum of the
   penalties of its components (see [path_size]).

   The search is best-first on that weight:
   - candidates sit in a queue ordered by weight; levels (all candidates of the
     same weight) are validated in increasing order. Validating a candidate
     means finding its name in the printing environment and checking that it
     denotes what the candidate stood for; it is then filed in a table under the
     canonical path it denotes, or kept aside until the environment changes;
   - after each level the table is consulted for the canonical path of the
     request. The search stops as soon as the best name found is strictly
     lighter than everything left.

   Rule D3 is lazy: the components of a module known under the apparent path
   [a] are only materialised ("expanded") when the search is about to validate
   a level that one of them could belong to, that is when weight(a) + 1 is not
   heavier than that level: a component adds at least one name to the module's
   path, and a path regrafted under a component by a substitution is heavier
   still. An expansion runs before any level its components could reach, so
   when a level is validated every candidate of that weight is in the queue, and
   when the search stops the remaining expansions can only produce heavier
   names. (A substitution whose target is exactly a new component could name it
   lighter than the module; such a target is a node of the trie whenever it is
   the request's own path, which is added to the trie at every call, so that
   name is produced by the substitution pass of the call.)

   The whole search state persists across the calls of a typing: candidates are
   validated once, and a later call resumes where the previous one stopped. *)
